A button for processing.

This is a calculated button for processing without using the textWidth function which sometimes doesn't work (for my it never did).

This code has two functions, the one with the button (the crappy one) and the other that calculates the width of the string (this one, i did it by counting the pixels of each letter, upper case and lower case).

In the future i will make prettier buttons, but for now this is all.
